\fISparse1.3\fP is a flexible package of subroutines written in C used
to solve large sparse systems of linear equations quickly and
accurately.  The package can handle arbitrary real and complex square
matrix equations.  Besides solving linear systems, can also quickly
solve transposed systems, find determinants, and estimate errors due to
ill-conditioning in the system of equations and instability in the
computations.  \fISparse\fR also provides a test program that read
matrix equations from a file, solve them, and print useful information
about the equation and its solution.
.PP
\fISparse1.3\fR has replaced \fISparse1.2\fR providing greater
capability and speed, and more refined interface to the calling program.
\fISparse\fR is generally as fast as or faster than other popular sparse
matrix packages when solving many matrices of similar structure.
\fISparse\fR does not require or assume symmetry, and it is able to
perform numerical pivoting to avoid unnecessary error in the solution.
It handles its own memory allocation, sparing the user the hassle of
providing adequate memory.  It also has a natural, flexible, and
efficient interface to the calling program.

\fISparse\fR was originally written for use in circuit simulators and is
particularly apt at handling node- and modified-node admittance
matrices.  The systems of linear equations generated in a circuit
simulator stem from solving large systems of nonlinear equations using
Newton's method and integrating large stiff systems of ordinary
differential equations.  However, \fISparse\fR is also suitable for
other uses, including solving the very large systems of linear equations
resulting from the numerical solution of partial differential equations.

The \fISparse1.3\fR package was written in the C programming language by
Kenneth Kundert, and versions exist for the \s-1UNIX\s+1 and
\s-1VAX/VMS\s+1 operating systems.  Be sure to specify the version when
ordering.  The package includes source for the \fISparse\fP subroutine
library, the test program, and two sets of interface routines.
The first set provides a \fISparse1.2\fR interface, to make
\fISparse1.3\fR backward-compatible, and the second allows \fISparse1.3\fR
to be called from FORTRAN programs.  Also included in the package is a
user's guide and a large collection of test matrices.
